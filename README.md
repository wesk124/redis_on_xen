# Redis on Xen

Redis on Xen is to run redis servers on several 
Xen guests and benchmark these server on dom0.
I am currently using the default parameters for
redis benchmark.

The user should prepare Xen, delpoy Xen vm(s), start them and 
download redis in dom0 first. (After clone this repo
you will have a redis-3.2.3.)
